Madd Apocalypse
===============

An advanced engine for first-person shooters.

Features
========

* Custom maps, weapons, shaders, etc.
* Singleplayer and multiplayer, including the possibility to build a dedicated server.
* 3D sound (optional, using OpenAL).
* GPU-accelerated physics and particle systems using OpenCL (optional).

System Requirements
===================

The engine on its own requires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3 or newer. Other requirements mostly depend on
the type of game you are trying to run. We also recommend a GPU that supports OpenCL (any version), as this
is used to optimize the engine.
